# 👋 Hi, I am Gonzalo Respighi Grasso

🎓 Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at UC Santa Cruz (expected 2027)  
📍 Based in Santa Cruz, CA | Originally from Argentina  
🎯 Bridging causal inference and machine learning to understand how people make decisions and how policies shape behavior.

## 👨‍💻 About me

I am an applied microeconomist working at the intersection of causal inference, machine learning, and large-scale data systems. I specialize in turning messy, high-dimensional data into empirical evidence and deployable models that inform policy, product decisions, and strategic planning. Before starting my Ph.D., I worked across Argentina’s public sector, private sector, and independent consulting. I built forecasting pipelines, developed production-grade ML models, engineered data workflows, and led causal impact evaluations directly for government agencies and firms. In my academic work, I use rich administrative microdata to study residential sorting and household behavior. My research combines quasi-experimental methods with modern ML techniques, keeping a strong focus on external validity and real-world mechanisms. Across industry and academia, my goal is the same: to produce evidence and tools that are both statistically rigorous and operationally meaningful.
