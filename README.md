## 👨‍💻 About me

I am an applied microeconomist specializing in causal inference and machine learning, with hands-on experience transforming large-scale, messy, real-world data into empirical evidence that informs policy and strategic decisions. My work integrates reduced-form causal methods, predictive modeling, and modern data engineering practices, with applications in a wide range of topics.

Before beginning my Ph.D., I worked in Argentina’s public sector, private sector, and independent consulting. Across these roles, I designed and implemented forecasting systems, built data pipelines, ran policy impact evaluations, and delivered empirical analyses directly to government officials and industry stakeholders. This experience shaped a practical, results-oriented perspective on how causal inference and machine learning can be applied in operational environments.

Since moving to the United States in 2022, my work has focused on academic research using rich administrative microdata. My research agenda centers on residential sorting, studying how households adjust where they live in response to policy changes, public goods, or shifts in local political representation.

Across industry and academia, I aim to connect rigorous identification strategies with real-world relevance: producing evidence that is not only statistically credible but also operationally meaningful.
