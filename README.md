## 👨‍💻 About me

I’m an applied microeconomist and data scientist with hands-on experience designing and implementing causal inference strategies and machine learning models using large-scale, messy, real-world data.

Before my Ph.D., I worked in the public sector, academia, and consulting — always using data to answer hard questions.

My current research combines **econometric design**, **ML tools**, and **administrative microdata** to study housing, credit, and mobility in the U.S. and Latin America.
