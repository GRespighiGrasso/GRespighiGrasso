# 👋 Hi, I am Gonzalo Respighi Grasso

🎓 Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at UC Santa Cruz (expected 2027)  
📍 Based in Santa Cruz, CA | Originally from Argentina  
🎯 I build end-to-end analytical systems; from identification and modeling, to validation, interpretation, and operational use, to study human behavior and policy-relevant decisions.

## 👨‍💻 About me

I am an applied microeconomist working at the intersection of causal inference, machine learning, and large-scale data systems. I specialize in turning messy, high-dimensional data into empirical evidence and deployable models that inform policy, product decisions, and strategic planning. Before starting my Ph.D., I worked across Argentina’s public sector, private sector, and independent consulting. I built forecasting pipelines, developed production-grade ML models, engineered data workflows, and led causal impact evaluations directly for government agencies and firms. In my academic work, I use rich administrative microdata to study residential sorting and household behavior. My research combines quasi-experimental methods with modern ML techniques, keeping a strong focus on external validity and real-world mechanisms. Across industry and academia, my goal is the same: to produce evidence and tools that are both statistically rigorous and operationally meaningful.

## 📂 My repositories

My repositories reflect how I learn, think, and work. Over time, I found that the most effective way for me to truly understand complex ideas is to articulate them clearly in writing and to illustrate them with concrete, reproducible code. Many of these repositories are therefore structured as self-contained learning and reference modules, combining theory, simulations, and implementation in a way that makes concepts easier to reason about and reuse. The tools and frameworks in these repositories come from different sources. Some were learned independently through books. Others emerged from practical constraints in my professional work, where real-world problems required me to quickly acquire, adapt, and operationalize new methods. In several cases, my work pushed me to revisit techniques I had already studied, strengthening them through production use, robustness checks, and clearer abstraction.
